I am a graduate software developer with a passion for clever algorithms and cool computer graphics. I am currently working for MNF Group as a C++ developer, and was previously a tutor for "Introduction to Programming" at the University of New South Wales. In my spare time, I enjoy modding video games and perfecting my drum-playing ability.
